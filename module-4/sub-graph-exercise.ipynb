    "By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design and implement sub-graphs** with different state schemas for specialized tasks\n",
    "2. **Manage state communication** between parent graphs and sub-graphs using overlapping keys\n",
    "3. **Create output schemas** to control what data flows between graph components\n",
    "4. **Build multi-agent systems** where different agents work on specialized sub-tasks\n",
    "5. **Handle parallel execution** of sub-graphs with proper state management\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario: Customer Support Analytics System\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll build a customer support analytics system that processes customer tickets through specialized sub-graphs:\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Analyzes customer sentiment and urgency\n",
    "- **Resolution Tracker Agent**: Tracks resolution patterns and success metrics\n",
    "- **Knowledge Base Agent**: Identifies knowledge gaps and suggests improvements\n",
    "\n",
